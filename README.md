# TriggerFix
Fix for Oculus controllers not registering a full press in Beat Saber

With this mod you only need to press the trigger 50% of the way to click on buttons.

Since Meta/Oculus headset controllers don't have a physical click and are analog only they sometimes develop an issue where pressing the trigger all the way only counts as something like 89% instead of 100%. Most applications don't actually require you to press it all the way to click on things but Beat Saber does, so if you run into an issue where its hard or impossible to click things in Beat Saber this mod can fix that.

Note: This mod is only for -vrmode oculus!
If you use SteamVR you can use the controller binding editor thats built into steamvr to adjust click thresholds
